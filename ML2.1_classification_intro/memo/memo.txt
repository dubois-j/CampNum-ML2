1) What are the necessary preprocessing steps regarding:
a) classes ?
- Remove target variables from training data

b) categorical features ? 
- Transform them into one column per possible categorical value (0/1)

c) continuous features ?
- Scale

2) Confusion matrix:
a)How many patient were incorrectly diagnosed with a Heart disease (false positives) ?
6
b)How many patient were incorrectly diagnosed as being Healthy (false negatives)?
9

3) Changing the threshold:
a)What is the precision if we change the threshold to have a 0.95 recall ? 
0.48148148148148145
b) How many patient were incorrectly diagnosed as being Healthy (false negatives)?
2


4) Choosing an overall metric:

a) If I can compute my test sample probabilities and care more about the positive class, which overall metric should I use to compare classifiers ? 
Average precision

b) And if I only have the class predictions and no probabilities ?
True positive rate
